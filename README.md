## Notes

### Implementation
* Since we're consuming the data from a flaky API, it's important to not break the UX
* For that reason, I've decided to go with a SSG strategy and fetch the first 12 elements from the API at deploy time, meaning that those first 12 elements will always be present on the page no matter what
* For the rest of the elements, there's a CSR strategy, I've added a "retry" method in case of failure (max. 5 retries)
* In the case of failure the app will try to fetch the data again, until the 5th time, if it's still failing, then a button with the label "Load more houses" will be presented to the user

### Improvements
* For image optimization, I'd use the next/image component, but that requires devs to know all domains from which the images will be served, in this case I don't have that information. In a production app I'd host the images in a S3 bucket and serve them through a CDN
* For large lists I'd try to use a virtualization approach (just keeping a set of records big enough to populate the viewport) as it will improve performance when loading hundreds of lines in the DOM, this might be more suitable for tables and grids, but in catalogs It'd be better to have a pagination method, as it'll make it easier to narrow results and bookmark them
* Some unit tests are missing due to the complexity of the components, in those cases I think it's better to implement integration tests

### Storybook
* I've built a small design system with Storybook on top, so you can play with. It allows you to change some settings on the "Button" component such as type, color, label. In a production application I'd spend more time in adding more controls, so it's useful to different stakeholders (not just the dev team) by allowing them to have an insight of what we're capable of building with the UI components we've already created
* It can also be used to demo very small pocs (maybe a user profile page), it's just putting the pieces together (just like lego bricks)

### Monorepo
* I've decided to use NX for this challenge since Jerry mentioned that the Monorepo architecture is what you are currently using in HomeVision, so I just wanted to show you what NX is capable of and how it might be used in a production ecosystem

### Time spent
* ~10hs
