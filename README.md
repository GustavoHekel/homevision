## Notes

### Implementation
* Since we're consuming the data from a flaky API, it's important to not break the UX
* For that, I've added a "retry" method in case of failure (max. 5 retries)
* In the case of failure the app will try to fetch the data again, until the 5th time, if it's still failing, then a button with the label "Load more houses" will be presented to the user

### Improvements
* For image optimization, I'd use the next/image component, but that requires devs to know all domains from which the images will be served, in this case I don't have that information. In a production app I'd host the images in a S3 bucket and serve them through a CDN
* For large lists I'd try to use a virtualization approach (just keeping a set of records big enough to populate the viewport) as it will improve performance when loading hundreds of lines in the DOM, this might be more suitable for tables and grids, but in catalogs It'd be better to have a pagination method, as it'll make it easier to narrow results and bookmark them
* Some unit tests are missing due to the complexity of the components, in those cases I think it's better to implement integration tests

### Time spent
* ~9hs
